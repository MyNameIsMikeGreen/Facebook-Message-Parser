# Facebook-Message-Parser
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/mikegreen1995/Facebook-Message-Parser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mikegreen1995/Facebook-Message-Parser)

Convert a Facebook message archive to an SQLite database for further querying.

**Notice**: As of 2018, Facebook has overhauled the format of their data archive dumps. This project has been updated to support this new format exclusively. If you require compatibility with the pre-2018 format, you may try the [v1.0.0 release](https://github.com/mikegreen1995/Facebook-Message-Parser/releases/tag/v1.0.0) but this version is not maintained.
