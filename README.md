# Facebook-Message-Parser
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/mikegreen1995/Facebook-Message-Parser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mikegreen1995/Facebook-Message-Parser)

Convert a Facebook message archive to an SQLite database for further querying.

**Notice**: As of 2018, Facebook has overhauled the format of their data archive dumps and the existing parser will not work with the amendments. At this stage, this project is for use exclusively for pre-2018 Facebook message archives.
